# Public tool counter API

## Contract

Both endpoints are public, under /api/v1/tools, and send Cache-Control: no-store. Responses use flat {ok,...} envelopes matching ERPCons.

POST /visits accepts a JSON object with tool matching /^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,47}$/. Successful calls return HTTP 200 and {"ok":true}. Invalid JSON/body or tool returns HTTP 400 with {"ok":false,"message":"..."}; invalid tool also includes errors.tool. A rolling 120/hour/IP flood limit suppresses further increments while returning the same successful envelope.

GET /stats returns HTTP 200 and {"ok":true,"total":number,"tools":{"slug":number}}. total is the sum of all tool counts.

## Storage and integration

MySQL/InnoDB tables: tool_visits, visit_flood_locks and visit_flood_events. Counters use atomic SQL upserts. A database transaction and per-IP lock serialize flood checks across instances. IP addresses are HMAC hashed with VISIT_HASH_SECRET; expired flood records are cleaned periodically. The API receives only tool slugs.

The server defaults to 127.0.0.1:3003 and trusts only loopback proxy addresses. The independently deployed Next.js frontend configures its API proxy with BACKEND_URL. The two repositories share no source files or dependency links.

Tests use a dedicated qa slug and test IP, remove their own rows and verify malformed/empty JSON, invalid slugs, concurrent counting, proxy client IP, rolling limits and expiry.

## Signed rule packages

`GET /api/v1/rules/:kind` returns `{ok:true,package:null}` or a signed package for a lowercase hyphenated kind. The response is `Cache-Control: no-store`. It serves only the activated digest within its UTC effective dates. The server verifies Ed25519 before each response; missing key or failed verification returns 503. There is no public write endpoint. A local operator CLI stages, activates, or rolls back packages and records each action in `rule_audit`.

## Anonymous contributions

`POST /api/v1/contributions` accepts JSON `{toolId,domain,baseSnapshotId,proposedChanges:[{field,before,after}],sourceRefs:[{url,type}],jurisdiction}`. Nullable metadata can be omitted. The request body limit is 128 KiB on this route; the visit route keeps its 1 KiB limit. A valid submission returns HTTP 200 `{ok:true,receiptCode,status}` where status is `NEEDS_SOURCE` or `NEEDS_REVIEW`. Invalid or sensitive input returns 400; a duplicate returns 409 with `code:DUPLICATE_CONTRIBUTION`; the sixth distinct submission within a rolling hour for one HMAC IP returns 429. No AI output is trusted or published by this API.

`GET /api/v1/contributions/receipt/:code` returns `{ok:true,contribution:{status,createdAt}|null}` with no proposed content or reviewer identity. The 24-byte random receipt is stored only as a SHA-256 hash. `GET /api/v1/contributions/ideas` returns the latest 50 published ideas. Both GET endpoints send `Cache-Control: no-store`.

`POST /api/v1/contributions/receipt/:code/sources` accepts `{sourceRefs:[{url,type}]}` only while the receipt is in `NEEDS_SOURCE`, changes it to `NEEDS_REVIEW`, and records `SOURCES_ADDED`. It returns 404 for unknown receipts or already progressed submissions. The route has a 22 KiB body limit.

The trusted CLI transitions `NEEDS_REVIEW → VERIFIED → APPROVED → PUBLISHED` and records every transition. Reviewer, approver and publisher identities must differ. High-risk domains require an official-type reference and a human verification note. Publishing a rule contribution requires a staged Ed25519 package of the same kind, with valid dates; if the proposal names a base snapshot digest, it must still be active. The package activation and contribution audit share a transaction. Idea publication requires the same operator separation but no rule package. Public API clients cannot review, approve, or publish.
